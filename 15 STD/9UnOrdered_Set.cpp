/*                      unique elements and randomized
An unordered_set is an unordered associative container implemented using a hash table where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table
So that the insertion is always randomized.

All operations on the unordered_set take constant time O(1) on an average which can go up to linear time O(n) in the worst case
which depends on the internally used hash function, but practically they perform very well and generally provide a constant time lookup operation. 

The unordered_set can contain a key of any type â€“ predefined or user-defined data structure but all the keys must be unique.

unordered set is implemented as a hash table data structure whereas the regular set is implemented as a binary search tree data structure.

most used functions are:

The size() and empty() for capacity.
The find() for searching a key.
The insert () and erase() for modification.

lower_bound and upper_bound doesn't work, rest functions are same as sets
