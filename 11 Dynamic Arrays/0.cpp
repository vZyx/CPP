/* 
A dynamic array is quite similar to a regular array, but its size is modifiable during program runtime.
DynamArray elements occupy a contiguous block of memory.
Once an array has been created, its size cannot be changed.

However, a dynamic array is different. A dynamic array can expand its size even after it has been filled.
During the creation of an array, it is allocated a predetermined amount of memory.
This is not the case with a dynamic array as it grows its memory size by a certain factor when there is a need.
